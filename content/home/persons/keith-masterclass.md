Drawing from the Solutions Journalism Network’s learning across hundreds of solutions projects from its community of newsrooms and journalists, we’ll frame out key principles for: identifying opportunities for strong solutions projects, finding and vetting solutions story ideas, reporting and structuring solutions stories, connecting solutions stories to audience and community engagement activities. Come with your ideas. We’ll workshop them together, mapping out possible reporting and engagement approaches and, where possible, identifying specific models and sources to anchor your work.
